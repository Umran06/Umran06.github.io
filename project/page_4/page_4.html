      	 <h2>Liverpool Vs AC Milan</h2>
          <p>The 2005 UEFA Champions League Final was the final match of the 2004–05 UEFA Champions League, Europe's primary club football competition. The showpiece event was contested between Liverpool of England and Milan of Italy at the Atatürk Stadium in Istanbul, Turkey on 25 May 2005. Liverpool, who had won the competition four times, were appearing in their sixth final, and their first since 1985. Milan, who had won the competition six times, were appearing in their second final in three years and tenth overall.</p>

          <p>Each club needed to progress through the group stage and knockout rounds to reach the final, playing 12 matches in total. Liverpool finished second in their group behind 2004 runners-up AS Monaco and subsequently beat Bayer Leverkusen, Juventus and Chelsea to progress to the final. Milan won their group ahead of Barcelona and faced Manchester United, Internazionale and PSV Eindhoven before reaching the final.</p> 

         <p> Milan were regarded as favourites before the match and took the lead within the first minute through captain Paolo Maldini. Milan striker Hernán Crespo added two more goals before half-time to make it 3–0. In the second half Liverpool launched a comeback and scored three goals in a dramatic six-minute spell to level the scores at 3–3, with goals from Steven Gerrard, Vladimír Šmicer and Xabi Alonso. The scores remained the same during extra time, and a penalty shoot-out was required to decide the champions. The score was 3–2 to Liverpool when Andriy Shevchenko's penalty was saved by Liverpool goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek. Thus Liverpool won their fifth European Cup, were awarded the trophy permanently, and claimed a multiple-winner badge. Liverpool's comeback gave rise to the final being known as the Miracle of Istanbul, and is regarded as one of the greatest finals in the history of the tournament.</p>

                
         <h2>Liverpool Vs West Ham</h2>
         <p>The 2006 FA Cup Final was a football match played between Liverpool and West Ham United on 13 May 2006 at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff. It was the final match of the 2005–06 FA Cup, the 125th season of the world's oldest football knockout competition, the FA Cup. Liverpool were participating in their 13th final, they had previously won six and lost six. West Ham were appearing in their fifth final, they had previously won three and lost once. This was the last final to be held at the Millennium Stadium while Wembley Stadium was rebuilt. Liverpool had won the first final to be held at the Millennium Stadium in 2001, when they beat Arsenal 2–1.[2] The match has been called The Gerrard Final and is widely regarded as one of the greatest cup finals in the history of the competition. </p>

        <p>As both teams were in the highest tier of English football, the Premier League, they entered the competition in the third round. Matches up to the semi-final were contested on a one-off basis, with a replay taking place if the match ended in a draw. Liverpool's matches varied from close affairs to comfortable victories. They beat Manchester United 1–0 in the fifth round, while they won 7–0 against Birmingham City in the sixth round. The majority of West Ham's matches were close, with their only match to be decided by more than one goal being their 4–2 victory against Blackburn Rovers in the fourth round.</p> 

         <p> Watched by a crowd of 71,140, West Ham took the lead in the first half when Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher scored an own goal, and striker Dean Ashton scored a few minutes later to make it 2–0 to West Ham. Liverpool scored, courtesy of Djibril Cissé, to make the score 2–1 at half time. They equalised not long after the restart via a Steven Gerrard goal. However, ten minutes later West Ham defender Paul Konchesky gave his team a 3–2 lead. With the match in injury time, Gerrard equalised from distance to make the score 3–3 and force the game into extra time. No further goals were scored in extra time meaning the match was to be decided by a penalty shoot-out. West Ham missed three of their four penalties while Liverpool converted three of four to win the shoot-out 3–1. </p>

         <p>The victory meant Liverpool won the FA Cup for the seventh time. They later played against league champions Chelsea in the 2006 FA Community Shield. Given Liverpool had already qualified for Europe via their league position, their UEFA Cup spot was awarded to runners-up West Ham. </p>

         <h2>Liverpool Vs Borussia Dortmund</h2>
         <p>Liverpool staged one of the most dramatic comebacks Anfield has seen to overcome Borussia Dortmund in a classic and reach the Europa League semi-finals.
         Jurgen Klopp's side were twice left needing three goals to go through in the face of Dortmund's rapier attacks - but climbed the mountain twice with Dejan Lovren's injury-time header from James Milner's cross concluding a night packed with drama and emotion. Anfield commemorated the 27th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, in which 96 supporters died, with an impeccably observed minute's silence before kick-off - followed by a thriller that will be recalled for generations for sheer excitement and a finale that sent Anfield wild.</p>

<p> The Bundesliga side struck twice inside the first nine minutes through Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang - both after swift breaks, with the latter sealed by a crisp 14-yard strike - to take a 3-1 aggregate lead in the tie.
The German side missed numerous more chances to extend their lead as Liverpool struggled to cope with their attacking threat.</p>
<p> The Reds slowly grew into the game, creating and missing a succession of chances. Even when Divock Origi gave them hope early in the second half - slotting the ball through the legs of keeper Roman Weidenfeller - it seemed to have been snuffed out by Marco Reus's cool 57th-minute finish.

They still needed three goals with less than 25 minutes left but Philippe Coutinho's low shot cut the deficit and when Mamadou Sakho headed in after 77 minutes, Liverpool stood on the brink of something remarkable.

Amid riotous scenes, Lovren rose to head home in stoppage time in front of the Kop to spark chaotic celebrations and seal a win that will take its place in Anfield folklore. </p>

   <h2>Liverpool Vs Manchester United</h2>
         <p>On a day when Liverpool badly needed a win Nemanja Vidic endured a miserable afternoon, as Rafa Benitez's side came away from Old Trafford with a stunning 4-1 victory over Manchester United that reignites the title race.

An enthralling contest in Manchester saw Vidic badly at fault as he was responsible for Fernando Torres' goal in the first half and was sent-off in the second.

Inevitably it was Torres and Steven Gerrard at the hub of a victory that reduces United's lead at the Premier League summit to four points, albeit with a game in hand, and will give Liverpool belief - if not conviction - that a 19-year wait for the title could be sated this season.</p>

<p>A Cristiano Ronaldo penalty after 23 minutes had United supporters revelling in their rivals' misery but it was a lead that lasted just five minutes as Torres capitalised on a rare Vidic error to equalise.

Gerrard picked himself up from the ground to dispatch a penalty after he was fouled by Patrice Evra to give his side the lead going into half-time, before Vidic saw red for a professional foul on Liverpool's skipper after the break.

From the resulting free-kick, with 13 minutes left on the clock, Fabio Aurelio bent a sumptuous effort past a crestfallen Edwin van der Sar.

United's woes were exacerbated in the final minute when Liverpool substitute Andrea Dossena lobbed a sublimely taken fourth over van der Sar. </p>

         <p> Here are some of the greatest goals in the past 10 years that has been scored at Anfield, so here is a Top 10 games at Anfield, from Jürgen Klopp's first Merseyside derby and the win over Everton to Stan Collymore breaking Kevin Keegan's heart with a last-gasp strike in the infamous 4-3 win in 1996.The 5-0 against villa was excellent and showed the free scoring team that Liverpool were. The most exciting games come from Liverpool vs Arsenal a game which is known for their goals and they never disappoints even if they end with a draw it would be a very entertaining draw.  </p>


 <h2>Liverpool vs Barcelona</h2>
         <p> Liverpool completed one of the greatest comebacks in football history, beating Barcelona 4-0 at Anfield and 4-3 on aggregate to reach the Champions League final.

Looking to become only the third team in the competition's history to come back from three goals down after the first leg of a semi-final, Liverpool took an early lead through Divock Origi's tap in (7) to give Anfield hope, before two goals in two second-half minutes brought them level. 
Half-time substitute Georginio Wijnaldum first saw his low drive sneak past Marc-Andre ter Stegen (54), and the Dutchman took the roof off Anfield as his precise header from Xherdan Shaqiri's cross found the corner of Barca's net (56). And the comeback was complete in bizarre and jaw-dropping fashion as Trent Alexander-Arnold's cheeky corner caught Barcelona off guard, allowing the unmarked Origi to turn home his second (79), having played most of this season as a bit-part player.

<p> Liverpool had a mountain to climb, but the frantic opening worked in their favour as Jordi Alba's poor header allowed Sadio Mane to feed Henderson, who drove into the area and forced a low stop from Ter Stegen, only for Origi to follow up and finish from close range.</p>
<p> Anfield erupted as Barca's defence cracked, but they eventually settled after 15 minutes as Lionel Messi forced a good save from Alisson from 12 yards, and the Liverpool goalkeeper was again at his best to parry away Philippe Coutinho's placed effort from the left of the box.


Luis Suarez, once a hero at Anfield, was soon being roundly jeered by the home fans for creating mischief among Liverpool's defence, with replays showing he may have kicked out at Andrew Robertson as the two ran beside each other.

Robertson had to be replaced at half-time by Wijnaldum, after Alisson had again kept the score at 1-0 with a fine block from Jordi Alba at close range following Messi's sublime through ball.

The breakneck speed continued after half-time as Ter Stegen showed fine reflexes to block Virgil van Dijk's backheeled volley from a corner, before Alisson made yet another smart save from Suarez's low drive.</p> </article>
